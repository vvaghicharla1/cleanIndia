# cleanIndia
Clean India is the platform which provides services to clean up the waste on your area. The main idea is: Ask the user snaps a picture of a surrounding with providing an option to submit the intensity level. We'll have an interface to contact the local agencies for collecting waste and will create a platform to raise the funds inside the project. Through raised funds, we will create local jobs, our interface make those funds available based on their location(Auto) or any desired location wherever the user wants to allocate. The main aim here is to create user a platform to report the waste, create local jobs, and create awareness for everyone how to take ownership of their surroundings.
